title: My Experience with Bloc

<h1>Why did I enroll at Bloc?</h1>
<p>Before starting with Bloc, I was trying the free online courses that they offered online. I felt like I was learning, but the learning scale felt slow and very random. I was already working for a startup and they all knew that I wanted to become a web developer. I felt that I needed to improve and improve faster, more focused, instead wasting time to see what courses that I should take, what languages that I should study and how to do that all at the same time. I am overall happy that I joined Bloc. Not saying that it was challenging at all. It is. I still feel like whatever amount of time that I put on is not enough, but I need to remind myself that this is a lifetime knowledge that will take more than checkpoints, meetings with mentor. I still have a lot to learn but I am more than happy for joining Bloc.
