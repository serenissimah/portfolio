title: My Biggest Challenge
---
<p>I've been transitioning from practicing law into software development and I actually noticed that the skills that I learned can be used into software development. The critical thinking and the way to solve problems is very similar. However, even though I can see the similarities between both careers, it is still a whole different set of skills that only with dedication and focus will take to learn it.
