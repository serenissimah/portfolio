I was born and raised in Brazil. My parents move to Brazil in the 70s because of my father's work and I can tell that they fell in love with my hometown. I grew up in this little island that nowadays is attached to the shore. It is the capital of the state, not the biggest city, but not small either.

My background is in law where I graduated from the Federal University from my state. I was able to pass the BAR exam and was working for the State Court of Appeals even before I graduated.

I moved to Utah over a year ago and I love it here. I love the fact that we have 4 distinct seasons, a lot of outdoors activities, and the city is mostly safe. I work for a start up company and I look forward to study hard and move to another department.

I am very passionate about learning. From languages, I speak 4 languages fluently, to Quantum Physics. I actually was placed 7th place on the Physics Olympiad when I was in high school. I love reading and just learning in general.
