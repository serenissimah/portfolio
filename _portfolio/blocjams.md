## Explanation
BlocJams was my first project as student at Bloc and the purpose is to build a website similar to Spotify, a form to stream and play music.

## Problem
The Problem with BlocJams was- as a beginning developer, I never build a website in my life and as much I learn by watching the videos and tutorials online, it is not the same. Some of the code was pre-written, however some of other lines we had to actually write it and that was very challenging. Debugging also a difficulty that I learn by experience.

## Solution
With my mentor's help through this journey of checking the work, making all the mistakes possible and debugging everything, I had to put a lot of hours trying to debug everything.

## Results
After getting used to check my work often aka "all the time" and debug the errors, it is an actually a real working music player!!!

## Conclusion
Going into this project I was very intimidated, I don't have any experiences in writing codes, debug, check my work. It was hard and challenging. In the future, I have learned that troubleshooting and checking my work before making commits is crucial!
